# Poor Man's Scraper

Welcome 😁, this is really simple scraper that currently only scrapes for Amazon Data

## Tech Stack

1. Vue + Quasar for frontend
    - Vue is cool and Quasar is great for fast prototyping
2. .NET Core WebAPI for backend
3. Playwright to run headless browser and as parsing tool
4. Nginx as a reverse proxy/load balancer

I would prefer to seperate both backend and frontend to their respective subdomains, but this is easier for now.
